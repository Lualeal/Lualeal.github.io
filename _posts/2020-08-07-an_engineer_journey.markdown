My enginner journey started when I graduated as a Chemical Engineer back in Brazil. Since I moved to San Francisco I have been surrounded by tech companies.

I have had a little bit of experience with coding from when I was a student, and the memories of the joy I felt when I first coded made me think "why not?".
I live where the best tech companies are. It would be just silly not to enjoy this chance. I have to try and feel that excitement of writing my first real code again. So, here I am.
